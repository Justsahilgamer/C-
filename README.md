# C++
Common c++ codes
note:This codes are not compiled because the code can be different in some different versions of compiler(Turbo C++,visual studio code,etc)
you may have to do changes in the code to compile it in your machine. 
changes like-1. "add <conio.h>"
             2. "add getch() and clrscr()".
			 
THIS CODE 100% WORKS ON UPDATED C++ COMPILERS. like(g++,visual studio code).


NOTE:that heirarchy.cpp is only for roll no 101.if you want that for any roll no contact me-https://www.instagram.com/justsahilgamer/
